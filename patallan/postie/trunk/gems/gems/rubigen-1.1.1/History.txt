* Promoted 'application_generator' and 'component_generator' to Rubigen
from NewGem project (they are available even if newgem not installed)
* install_rubigen_scripts default test fixed by mapping scopes to strings
* version.js uploaded to website

== 1.0.8 2007-11-03

* install_rubigen_scripts adds 'test_unit' to scopes unless a test-related scope is added
* remove examples directory because it's redundant.  See rails gem. [Winston Tsang]

== 1.0.6 2007-10-18

* Templates can end with .erb (e.g. model.rb.erb) and template_copy_each will remove the .erb extension (create model.rb)

== 1.0.5 2007-10-08

* Added Jeremy Kemper to license/copyright/gem author list.

== 1.0.4 2007-09-07

* New manifest actions:
  * m.folder - copies over all files in folder into target path
* helper run_generator returns generator instance (so you can assert instance variables/methods etc)
* base_name method for generators - returns basename of destination_root, unless its trunk/tags/branches

== 1.0.3 2007-08-22

* /generators folder is automatically picked up by all component/app generators [bug fix]

== 1.0.2 2007-08-22

* Renamed rubigen_install_script -> install_rubigen_script
* install_rubigen_script is now a component generator so can be reused by other generators to create script/generate
* Added "Thanks to Jeremy Kemper" into website
* Cleaned up USAGE for test_unit
* If a generator does not have a USAGE file, then it is invisible from lists of available generators.
  This will be the mechanism for having hidden generators (e.g. install_rubigen_scripts)

* Moved builtin generators into root folders, away from lib folder, to protected them
  from ri/rdocs processes (which didn't like ERb <%= %> inside Ruby files)
