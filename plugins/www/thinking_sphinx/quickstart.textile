h2. Quickstart

Okay, here's the brief explanation of how to set up Thinking Sphinx.

h3. Install Sphinx

Go grab the files you need from "the Sphinx site":http://sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html.

h3. Install Thinking Sphinx

<pre><code>script/plugin install
  http://rails-oceania.googlecode.com/svn/patallan/plugins/CURRENT/thinking_sphinx</code></pre>

h3. Set up your indexes

Say you have an Article model, you might want to do something like the following - adapt to taste.

<pre><code>class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  # ...
  
  define_index do
    indexes subject, :sortable => true
    indexes content
    indexes author.name, :as => :author, :sortable => true
    
    has author_id, created_at, updated_at
  end
  
  # ...
end</code></pre>

h3. Index your data

Run the @thinking_sphinx:index@ rake task.

h3. Fire up Sphinx

Run the @thinking_sphinx:start@ rake task.

h3. Get Searching!

Again with an Article model:

<pre><code>Article.search "topical issue"
Article.search "something", :order => :created_at, :sort_mode => :desc
Article.search "everything", :conditions => {:author_id => 5}
Article.search :conditions => {:subject => "Sphinx"}</code></pre>

And that's pretty much it - for more detail, check out the "usage":/usage.html page.
