h2. What?

A concise and easy-to-use Ruby library that connects ActiveRecord to the "Sphinx":http://sphinsearch.com search daemon, managing configuration and searching.

h2. Why?

Sphinx is a very fast search engine that indexes data and provides flexible ways of searching it. Thinking Sphinx allows you to link up your models into Sphinx simply and painlessly - because let's face it, searching across multiple fields using SQL is a pain in the neck.

h2. Where?

Grab the current version straight into your plugins directory using @script/plugin install@ or "Piston":http://piston.rubyforge.org/ using the following URL:

<pre><code>http://rails-oceania.googlecode.com/svn/patallan/plugins/CURRENT/thinking_sphinx</code></pre>

h2. Who?

"Pat Allan":http://freelancing-gods.com is the developer behind Thinking Sphinx, and the underlying API for Sphinx, "Riddle":http://riddle.freelancing-gods.com.

h2. Most importantly, How?

Ah, well that deserves a couple of pages - firstly, the "quickstart guide":/quickstart.html, and then for more detail, have a read of the "usage page":/usage.html, which cover setting up and using both Sphinx and Thinking Sphinx.
